MISSING TESTS

Please add tests to this directory ($thisDir), then delete or rename and
repurpose this file ($thisFile).

- If your package implements a CLI only:
  Tests are expected to be *shell scripts* run by *Urchin*;
  see https://github.com/tlevine/urchin
  Tests for standard CLI options -h/--help and --version
  were added.

- If your package (also) implements a JS module:
  Tests are run with *tap*, and can either be shell scripts
  or *.js files - see https://www.npmjs.com/package/tap
  A sample tap test was added.

(To make do without tests, simply remove all content from $thisDir)
